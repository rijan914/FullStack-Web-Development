  <summary>What is Node.js?</summary>
  <p>Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment. It allows developers to run JavaScript on the server side, outside of a browser.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Key Features of Node.js:</summary>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Event-driven and Asynchronous:</strong> Non-blocking I/O makes it ideal for handling multiple requests simultaneously.</li>
      <li><strong>Single-threaded but Scalable:</strong> Uses a single thread with event looping to handle many connections.</li>
      <li><strong>Fast Execution:</strong> Built on V8, it compiles JavaScript directly into machine code for speed.</li>
      <li><strong>NPM (Node Package Manager):</strong> A huge library of open-source packages to accelerate development.</li>
      <li><strong>Cross-platform:</strong> Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS.</li>
    </ul>

  <summary>What is the Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) in JavaScript?</summary>
  <p>The Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) in JavaScript refers to the period of time during which a variable is declared using <code>let</code> or <code>const</code> but has not yet been initialized. During this time, any attempt to access the variable will result in a ReferenceError. The TDZ starts from the beginning of the block where the variable is declared and ends when the variable is initialized with a value. This behavior helps prevent the use of variables before they are properly initialized, which can lead to bugs and unpredictable behavior in the code.</p>

  <summary>What is Lexical Scoping in JavaScript?</summary>
  <p>Lexical scoping, also known as static scoping, is a convention used in JavaScript to determine the scope of a variable based on its position within the source code. In lexical scoping, a variable defined inside a function is only accessible within that function and any nested functions. This means that the scope of a variable is determined by the structure of the code and the location where the variable is declared, rather than the runtime context. Lexical scoping helps in maintaining the modularity and predictability of the code by ensuring that variables are only accessible within their defined scope.</p>

  <summary>What are undefined and null in JavaScript?</summary>
  <p>In JavaScript, <code>undefined</code> and <code>null</code> are two distinct types that represent the absence of a value.

  <strong>undefined:</strong> A variable is automatically assigned the value <code>undefined</code> when it is declared but not initialized. It indicates that a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value. For example:
  <pre><code>let a;
  console.log(a); // Output: undefined</code></pre>

  <strong>null:</strong> <code>null</code> is an assignment value that can be explicitly set to indicate that a variable has no value. It is often used to signify that a variable should be empty. For example:
  <pre><code>let b = null;
  console.log(b); // Output: null</code></pre>

  While both <code>undefined</code> and <code>null</code> represent the absence of a value, they are used in different contexts and have different meanings. <code>undefined</code> is typically used by the JavaScript engine, whereas <code>null</code> is used by programmers to indicate an intentional absence of value.</p>

  <summary>What are primitive and non-primitive data types in JavaScript?</summary>
  <p>In JavaScript, data types can be categorized into two main types: primitive and non-primitive (or reference) data types.

  <strong>Primitive Data Types:</strong> These are the most basic data types in JavaScript and include:
  <ul>
    <li><code>String</code>: Represents textual data. Example: <code>let str = "Hello";</code></li>
    <li><code>Number</code>: Represents numeric data. Example: <code>let num = 42;</code></li>
    <li><code>Boolean</code>: Represents true or false values. Example: <code>let isTrue = true;</code></li>
    <li><code>Undefined</code>: Represents a variable that has been declared but not initialized. Example: <code>let a;</code></li>
    <li><code>Null</code>: Represents an intentional absence of value. Example: <code>let b = null;</code></li>
    <li><code>Symbol</code>: Represents a unique and immutable value. Example: <code>let sym = Symbol('sym');</code></li>
    <li><code>BigInt</code>: Represents integers with arbitrary precision. Example: <code>let bigInt = 123n;</code></li>
  </ul>

  <strong>Non-Primitive Data Types:</strong> These are also known as reference data types and include:
  <ul>
    <li><code>Object</code>: Represents a collection of properties. Example: <code>let obj = { name: "John", age: 30 };</code></li>
    <li><code>Array</code>: Represents an ordered list of values. Example: <code>let arr = [1, 2, 3];</code></li>
    <li><code>Function</code>: Represents a block of code designed to perform a particular task. Example: <code>function greet() { console.log("Hello"); }</code></li>
  </ul>

  Primitive data types are immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed once created. Non-primitive data types, on the other hand, are mutable and can have their properties or elements modified. Additionally, primitive data types are stored directly in the memory location, whereas non-primitive data types are stored as references to the memory location.</p>

  <summary>What is the difference between var and let in JavaScript?</summary>
  <p>In JavaScript, <code>var</code> and <code>let</code> are used to declare variables, but they have different behaviors.

  When JavaScript code is executed, it goes through two phases: the creation phase and the execution phase. During the creation phase, the JavaScript engine scans the code and allocates memory for variables and functions. This is known as hoisting.

  <strong>var:</strong> Variables declared with <code>var</code> are hoisted to the top of their containing function or global scope. During the creation phase, they are initialized with <code>undefined</code>. This means that you can reference a <code>var</code> variable before its declaration without causing an error, but it will have the value <code>undefined</code> until the execution phase assigns it a value. For example:
  <pre><code>console.log(a); // Output: undefined
  var a = 10;
  console.log(a); // Output: 10</code></pre>

  <strong>let:</strong> Variables declared with <code>let</code> are also hoisted, but they are not initialized. Instead, they are placed in a "temporal dead zone" (TDZ) from the start of the block until the declaration is encountered. Accessing a <code>let</code> variable before its declaration will result in a ReferenceError. For example:
  <pre><code>console.log(b); // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'b' before initialization
  let b = 20;
  console.log(b); // Output: 20</code></pre>

  In summary, <code>var</code> is function-scoped and initialized with <code>undefined</code> during the creation phase, while <code>let</code> is block-scoped and not initialized until the execution phase, resulting in a ReferenceError if accessed before declaration.</p>

  <summary>What is "use strict" in JavaScript?</summary>
  <p><code>"use strict"</code> is a directive introduced in ECMAScript 5 that enables strict mode in JavaScript. Strict mode is a way to opt in to a restricted variant of JavaScript, which helps catch common coding mistakes and "unsafe" actions, such as defining global variables. It can be applied to an entire script or to individual functions.

  <strong>Benefits of using "use strict":</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>Eliminates some JavaScript silent errors by changing them to throw errors.</li>
    <li>Fixes mistakes that make it difficult for JavaScript engines to perform optimizations, leading to faster code execution.</li>
    <li>Prohibits some syntax likely to be defined in future versions of ECMAScript.</li>
  </ul>

  <strong>Examples of strict mode behavior:</strong>
  <pre><code>
  // Without strict mode
  x = 10; // This will not throw an error
  console.log(x); // Output: 10

  // With strict mode
  "use strict";
  y = 20; // This will throw a ReferenceError: y is not defined
  console.log(y);
  </code></pre>

  <strong>How to enable strict mode:</strong>
  <pre><code>
  // For an entire script
  "use strict";
  // Your code here

  // For a specific function
  function myFunction() {
    "use strict";
    // Function code here
  }
  </code></pre>

  In summary, <code>"use strict"</code> helps improve the quality of your code by catching common errors and preventing the use of unsafe features.</p>
